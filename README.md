# Mean Stack Practice App
This is a fullstack application made using the MEAN stack. I followed Traversy Media's [MEAN Stack Front to Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uONz0lEWft0&list=PLillGF-RfqbZMNtaOXJQiDebNXjVapWPZ) series. The application is hosted on Heroku [here](https://pure-beyond-22217.herokuapp.com/).
## MongoDB
I used MongoDB and mLab to store our users.
## Express.JS
The backend server was created with Node.js/Express and used Mongoose to organize models and query the db.
## Angular.JS
Angular and the Angular-CLI were used to generate components, services, and more.  
## Node.JS
Node.js was used in conjunction with Express to create our backend server.  
## Other Technologies
We also used JWT to login and store user data. These tokens add extra security for transmitting data.
## Goal
The goal of making this app was to get more practice with the MEAN stack and learn about authenticating users and working with databases.
